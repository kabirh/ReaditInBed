            Hey there,
          </p>
          <p>  
            I made RnB last summer while learning to code. I'd browse reddit while in bed giggling like an idiot, and my girlfriend (now fiance:) would ask me what I was laughing at. She'd look over at my screen and start giggling like an idiot too. Before long, we'd browse reddit in bed every night.</p>
            <p>We found all the tapping around tedious when all we wanted to do was view the images and the highest comment though.. So a few weekends of learning javascript later and we had the first version. A year later and you're enjoying the result of lots of tinkering as I learned to cobble things together out of code. It's still far from perfect, but it's better than nothing. Hope you find it as useful as we do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enjoy,
            <br>
