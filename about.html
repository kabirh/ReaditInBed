			<p>Thanks for checking out Reddit in Bed, I hope you like using it as much as I do. My favorite thing about Reddit is the amazing community, so I wanted to start bringing in comments from front page threads to start highlighting this. For the next version, I plan to start surfacing more great comments from every thread.

RnB is a nights and weekends project for me, to help me learn how to program and ship an app. And also to have the reddit client I've always wanted; something simple that's perfect for reading in bed. Far from perfect, RnB is a first step to realizing that.
